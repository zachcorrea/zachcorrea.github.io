This is the first post in blog that should have been easy to set up, but as usual, I found a way to overcomplicate the process. learned a whole lot about ruby, shells, paths, and bundles though! .. and I may have messed my computer up, but for now it seems to be working just fine, so we're live! Time to actually start coding!!



Testing out a [link](https://github.com/zachcorrea) to GitHub.
