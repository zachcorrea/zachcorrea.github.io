This is the first post in blog that should have been easy to set up, but as usual, I found a way to overcomplicate the process. learned a whole lot about ruby, shells, paths, and bundles though! .. and I may have messed my computer up, but for now it seems to be working just fine, so we're live! Time to actually start coding!!

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
