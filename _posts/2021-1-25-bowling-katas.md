title: Bowling Katas
---

The past couple weeks have been trying. Starting the bowling kata seemed straight forward at first. I would simply follow the instructions laid out, type the same code on my computer and miraculously have a working program. From there I would rinse and repeat every day until it became second nature to type out this program. From the very beginning, I kept recieving errors in the code I'd write. So I'd rewrite and rewrite, and eventually give up to try again the next day. to my surprise, the code would work! but nothing changed from the night before. simply accepting this good news, I pushed forward and kept getting passing test it was green all the way! until it wasnt again, same error. after several more days of adjusting and readjusting my code to make the tests pass I finally made it to the end. Feeling defeated and insecure about my abilities as a future programmer I couldn't understand why a simple task would give me such insurmountable trouble. 

After review with my mentor it came to his attention that there was a fatal flaw in the system. The code was correct, but somehow terminal was throwing errors and passes randomly. Terminal was not returning correct information at all... this whole time... I didn't realize terminal could return anything but the right answer, which is why I didnt speak up sooner. I just figured my code was wrong ((((most likely a parenthesis)))).

After a bit of celebration knowing I wasnt going crazy and or completely incompitent as future programmer, my mentor figured out what the issue was. a space. I named the folder "bowling katas" not realizing the storm that would ensue for breaking one of the foundational laws of computational canon. I promptly removed the space in the folder name. 

It worked. 




Lessons learned:

1) If I run into a problem that confounds me, I may not be TOTALLY incompitent at coding and just running into a system problem. 

2) I should contact my mentor after a reasonable amount of time spent troubleshooting the issue myself, instead of spending two weeks troubleshooting a problem in the code that didnt exist.

3) Never add a space to your folder name. :)
